" http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11489428/how-to-make-vim-paste-from-and-copy-to-systems-clipboard
" The "* and "+ registers are for the system's clipboard (:help registers).
" Depending on your system, they may do different things. For instance, on
" systems that don't use X11 like OSX or Windows, the "* register is used to
" read and write to the system clipboard. On X11 systems both registers can be
" used. See :help x11-selection for more details, but basically the "* is
" analogous to X11's PRIMARY selection (which usually copies things you select
" with the mouse and pastes with the middle mouse button) and "+ is analogous
" to X11's CLIPBOARD selection (which is the clipboard proper).

" If all that went over your head, try using "*yy or "+yy to copy a line to your
" system's clipboard. One or the other should work. You might like to remap this
" to something more convenient for you. For example, you could put vnoremap
" <C-c> "*y in your ~/.vimrc so that you can visually select and press Ctrl+c to
" yank to your system's clipboard.

" Be aware that copying/pasting from the system clipboard will not work if :echo
" has('clipboard') returns 0. In this case, vim is not compiled with the
" +clipboard feature and you'll have to install a different version or recompile
" it. Some linux distros supply a minimal vim installation by default, but
" generally if you install the vim-gtk package you can get the extra features.

" You also may want to have a look at the 'clipboard' option described at :help
" cb. In this case you can :set clipboard=unnamed or :set clipboard=unnamedplus
" to make all yanking/deleting operations automatically copy to the system
" clipboard. This could be an inconvenience in some cases where you are storing
" something else in the clipboard as it will override it.

" To paste you can use "+p or "*p (again, depending on your system and/or
" desired selection) or you can map these to something else. I type them
" explicitly, but I often find myself in insert mode. If you're in insert mode
" you can still paste them with proper indentation by using <C-r><C-p>* or
" <C-r><C-p>+. See :help i_CTRL-R_CTRL-P.

" It's also worth mentioning vim's paste option (:help paste). This puts vim
" into a special "paste mode" that disables several other options, allowing you
" to easily paste into vim using your terminal emulator or multiplexer's
" familiar paste shortcut. Simply type :set paste to enable it, paste your
" content and then type :set nopaste to disable it. Alternatively, you can use
" the pastetoggle option to set a keycode that toggles the mode (:help
" pastetoggle). I recommend using registers instead of these options, but if
" they are still too scary this can be a convenient workaround while you're
" perfecting your vim chops.
