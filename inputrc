# /etc/inputrc - global inputrc for libreadline
# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing for
# programs that use the GNU Readline library.  Existing
# programs include FTP, Bash, and GDB. Zsh does not use readline, instead it
# uses its own and more powerful zle. It does not read /etc/inputrc or
# ~/.inputrc .
# The bind -p command displays Readline function names and bindings in a format
# that can put directly into an initialization file. See Bash Builtins.
# For more information: 
# readline(3readline) and `info rluserman'
# https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Readline-Init-File.html
#
# You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r.
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
#
# First, include any system-wide bindings and variable
# assignments from /etc/Inputrc
$include /etc/inputrc

# Be 8 bit clean.
# don't strip characters to 7 bits when reading
set input-meta on
# display characters with the eighth bit set directly
# rather than as meta-prefixed characters
set output-meta on

# To allow the use of 8bit-characters like the german umlauts, uncomment
# the line below. However this makes the meta key not work as a meta key,
# which is annoying to those which don't need to type in 8-bit characters.

# following the cursor are not duplicated. For instance, if this is enabled,

# result in ‘Makefile’ rather than ‘Makefilefile’, assuming there is a single

# The best way to find out what a key or key combination sends for your
# terminal, is run sed -n l and to type it followed by Enter on the keyboard.
# Then you'll see something like:
# $ sed -n l
# ^[[1;5A
# \033[1;5A$
# The first line is caused by the local terminal
# echo done by the terminal device (it may not be reliable as terminal device
# settings would affect it).
# The second line is output by sed. The $ is not to be included, it's only to
# show you where the end of the line is.
# Above that means that Ctrl-Up (which I've pressed) send the 6 characters ESC,
# [, 1, ;, 5 and A (0x1b 0x5b 0x31 0x3b 0x35 0x41)
